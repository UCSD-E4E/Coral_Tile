Captive Portal
-----------
According to Wikipedia: A captive portal is a web page accessed with a web browser that is displayed to newly connected users of a Wi-Fi or wired network before they are granted broader access to network resources. This functionality will at a minimum give info to the user about where to find the actual web server. In a previous captive portal test, downloads did not work directly from the portal so the portal will either give info for connecting to the ESP32 or it will somehow launch an actual webpage.
